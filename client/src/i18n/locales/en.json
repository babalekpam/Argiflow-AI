      "q0": "What are AI Agents and how do they work?",
      "a0": "AI Agents are specialized autonomous systems that run specific tasks for your industry — like finding tax liens, scanning government contracts, or generating leads. Each agent follows a lifecycle: discover opportunities, analyze them, enrich with data, take action (send outreach, bid), and monitor results. You configure them once and they work 24/7.",
      "q1": "How long does implementation take?",
      "a1": "Sign up, configure your agents, and they start working immediately. Most users see their first leads within 24 hours. For more complex multi-system integrations, 2-4 weeks to fully optimize.",
      "q2": "Do I need technical knowledge?",
      "a2": "Not at all. The platform is designed for non-technical users. Browse the agent catalog, flip a switch to enable, and configure with simple settings. Our AI handles the complex parts.",
      "q3": "What regions do you support?",
      "a3": "We operate globally with two specialized brands: ArgiFlow for Western markets (US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia) and TradeFlow for African markets (Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, and 26+ more countries) — each with region-specific agents and pricing.",
      "q4": "Can you integrate with my existing tools?",
      "a4": "Yes. We integrate with CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot), email platforms (SendGrid), SMS (Twilio), calendars, and virtually any tool with an API. All integrations are configured from your Settings dashboard.",
      "q5": "What if it doesn't work for my business?",
